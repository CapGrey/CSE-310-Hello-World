# Overview

In this project, the goal was to write clear, concise code using
the procedural paradigm.

This was done by writing a main function that simply displays "Hello
World!" to the user. This is done by using the built in print 
function.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how to connect a 
project file to the version-control system 'git.'
